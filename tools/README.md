# Tools

This directory contains utility scripts for various tasks related to the AppBuilder package. Below are the details on how to use each script.

## `refresh-pdps.js`

This script gracefully pauses execution of the poller, and performs a 'cold start': the poller will then re-preview and re-publish all the products in the catalog.
The operation happens in the background and the script checks that the cold start was successfully triggered, exiting 0.

### Usage

`-l, --locales <locales>: Comma-separated list of locales (or stores) to delete. For example: en,fr,de`

## `check-products-count.js`

This script checks the product count consistency between the `published-products-index` and the Adobe Commerce store.
The products count is retrieved in Adobe Commerce via a Live Search query.
This script is a starting point to investigate issues in PDP publishing or rendering.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have the required environment variables set in your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    COMMERCE_STORE_CODE=<your_store_code>
    COMMERCE_STORE_URL=<your_store_url>
    COMMERCE_CONFIG_NAME=<your_config_name>
    ```

2. Run the script using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node check-products-count.js
    ```

3. The script will throw an error if the product counts do not match, indicating the expected and actual product counts. PLEASE NOTE: the number of products listed is just an indication to check for "macroscopic" failures, slight differences might be due to specific Commerce configs/attributes for certain products which might not show up in the query results.
4. In case of a mismatch, it is advised to check the logs and statistics of the service, by using [Adobe I/O cli](https://developer.adobe.com/runtime/docs/guides/getting-started/activations/) tool and looking at the invocation results - which are quite descriptive, to have more specific insights on the nature of the issue (whether it's a failed publish task, for example).

## `get-stats.js`

This script is used to generate charts and statistics from Adobe I/O Runtime poller activations. It can output data in multiple formats: a PNG chart, a JSON file with previewed URLs, and/or a CSV file with detailed statistics.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have the required environment variables set in your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    AIO_RUNTIME_NAMESPACE=<your_namespace>
    AIO_RUNTIME_AUTH=<your_auth_key>
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    node get-stats.js [options]
    ```

### Options

```
Options:
  -d, --date <DD-MM-YYYY>  Required. Specify the target date
  -f, --folder <path>      Required. Specify the output folder
  -c, --chart             Generate chart (outputs chart_dd-mm-yyyy.png)
  -j, --json             Generate JSON file with previewed URLs (outputs dd-mm-yyyy.json)
  -x, --csv              Generate CSV file with statistics (outputs dd-mm-yyyy.csv)
  -h, --help             Display help for command
```

At least one of `-c`, `-j`, or `-x` must be specified.

### Output Files

The script generates files in the specified output folder with the following naming convention:

- Chart: `chart_dd-mm-yyyy.png`
- JSON: `dd-mm-yyyy.json` (contains list of previewed URLs)
- CSV: `dd-mm-yyyy.csv` (contains detailed statistics)

The CSV file includes the following columns:
- Activation ID
- Start Date
- Duration (ms)
- State
- Failed count
- Ignored count
- Published count
- Unpublished count
- Preview Duration (avg ms)
- Preview Only flag

### Examples

```bash
# Generate all outputs (chart, JSON, and CSV)
node get-stats.js -d 20-03-2024 -f output -c -j -x

# Generate only CSV statistics
node get-stats.js -d 20-03-2024 -f output -x

# Generate chart and JSON
node get-stats.js -d 20-03-2024 -f output -c -j

# Using long-form options
node get-stats.js --date 20-03-2024 --folder output --chart --json --csv
```
